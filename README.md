# WoodburnImageConverter
Converts an image to black and white and show the outlines. Making it easier to transfer to a wood piece for pyrography.

The bulk of this code comes from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76413283/create-coloring-book-page-from-image
I added some user input to get the desired image to convert and tweak the values to get my desired output.
I then added an auto-save as png with an increasing file number, so it does not overwrite the same file if it already exist.
